# Introduction-of-Metaverse
### What Exactly is Metaverse ?
The metaverse is a virtual reality realm where it is envisioned that people can create avatars of themselves to interact with others in online worlds. It will be used for playing games but also in spaces such as work and music concerts and often accessed through a virtual reality headset. 


The Skills You’ll Need To Learn To Work in the Metaverse :

➢	Virtual Reality (VR) 
➢	Artificial Intelligence (AI)
➢	Extended or Mixed Reality (XR or MX)
➢	Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Technologies.
➢	Distributed Computing and Storage. 

### The Fundamentals of the Metaverse  : 
●	Technology had advanced drastically in the last 20th century. We had seen the advent of computers and the internet.

●	Web 1.0    :  We have seen Web 1.0 at the end of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century (up till 2004). The web was typically used for static websites, decentralized communication, and read-only platforms.       
                                                                                                                                                                                                      
●	Web 2.0 : We have seen Web 1.0 at the end of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century (up till 2004). The web was typically used for static websites, decentralized communication, and read-only platforms.


●	Web 3.0 : Now after this period the internet is quickly moving towards Web 3.0, where virtual environment and virtual interaction between users would be possible. This is referred to as Metaverse.


●	VR & Metaverse : Virtual reality (VR) and metaverse have seen extensive expansion, especially in recent years. In this regard, new niches keep appearing in this area. Among these niches, some of the most popular ones are entertainment and gaming. However, virtual technology is also making its way into education and health.


###	The three essential and contributing models for metaverse are:
●	    Gaming Engines
●	    Virtual Environments
●	    Virtual Economies

### The Devices of AR, VR, MR and XR :
VR and AR devices are both mounted on the head. However, VR devices deliver a view of the virtual world depicting a reality model, so it's basically a virtual space while AR provides the real world view along with virtual content anchoring on it.

●	Virtual reality is an artificial digital environment that completely substitutes the real world.
●	Augmented reality is the superimposition of digital content over the real-world environment.
●	In mixed reality, virtual content is not only superimposed on the real environment but is tied up and engages with that environment. 
●	Extended reality focuses on all real and virtual environments and human-machine interactions developed by computer technology and wearables.
Growth of Extended Reality Devices : 
As you know extended reality (XR) is a term comprising all real, virtual, combined environments along with human-machine engagements facilitated by computer technology and device wearables. Therefore XR includes all forms such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR) and the interpolated things among them. Many areas of extended reality are envisioned to foresee exponential growth in the next three years. But the most significant increase among these has been anticipated for AR Smartglasses, all-in-one AR devices, and standalone VR devices.

●	The extended reality market is anticipated to multiply by four times from USD 33.0 billion in 2021 to USD 125.2 billion by 2026, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 30.6%.
●	XR employs advanced computer technology, input systems, and graphics that empower learners to co-exist and interact with physical and digital objects in real-time. With mixed reality, learners can manage their vision in every direction with 360° maneuvering across an entire space and in every direction. 
●	This technology has the potential to bring revolution in many sectors.



### Implementation :
We have created web virtual world to experience virtual reality with A-frame. A-Frame is a free and open web framework for creating virtual reality experiences. It is maintained by Supermedium and Google developers. A-Frame is a Three.js entity component system framework that allows developers to create 3D and WebVR scenes using HTML.A-Frame handles the 3D and WebVR boilerplate required to get running across platforms including mobile, desktop, Vive, and Rift just by dropping in <a-scene>. WebVR is an open specification that allows you to experience virtual reality in your browser. The goal is to make it easier for everyone, regardless of device, to participate in VR experiences.

Web VR brought virtual reality to the web, making it easier for anyone to create, enjoy, and share VR experiences. The next phase of this evolution is WebXR, which will combine Web VR and AR into a single API. While the transition is happening our live Web VR experiments will not be accessible, however you can still demo some of the projects in 360.
